# Core Tools for COHRINT Research

This repository hosts common tools used by multiple experiments by the COHRINT lab group at CU Boulder's Aerospace Engineering Sciences.

**Any contributions to this repository must be made with the understanding that many projects pull from the same code base and you may break someone else's experiment by contributing.**
